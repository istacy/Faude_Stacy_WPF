//Introduction to functions

//sequential - Expressions : runs one line of code at a time in order
//conditional - if statements, ternarie
//reusable - functions
//repetitive

//Functions allow us to have code that is written once, but able to be used again and again by the machine

//DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself

//Functions Store Stuff - Stuff can go in and stuff can come out

//Types of Functions - functions, procedures, anonymous functions

//A basic function

/*function functionName(){
    //code the function runs
}*/

//Parenthesis are for parameters
//functions have hames so we can refer to them later.
